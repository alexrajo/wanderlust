_Running the application commands require you to navigate into the "./backpack" directory first._

To run the application locally use:

    npm run dev

_All changes made in ./src are replicated to the running application_

To run all tests once use:

    npm run simpletest

If you would rather run all tests immediately after updates are done to files in ./src use:

    npm run test
